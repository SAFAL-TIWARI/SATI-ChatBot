          "ABOUT DEPARTMENT",
          "The Department of Applied Science was set up in 1956 to impart higher education in Engineering Physics, Applied Chemistry and Applied Mathematics in addition to take up courses to three core engineering branches i.e. Civil, Electrical and Mechanical in 1st and 2nd year. In the Department Post graduate and Ph.D. programs were started in 1972. Presently, the department teaches courses in Applied Physics, Applied Chemistry and Mathematics to all the branches of Engineering. The Department of Applied Science has acquired and accomplished a number of projects in the field of science and technology, funded from reputed organizations like AICTE, New Delhi and MPCST, Bhopal attributable to key areas of research such as Nanomaterials, Electronics, Atmospheric Physics, Organic and Inorganic Chemistry. Re-designated as the Department of Applied Science from the academic session 2021-22, the department brings together the well qualified and experienced faculties from the Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics streams as the department aims to provide learner centric education to the students of First Year through innovative and methodical approach. The department looks towards inculcating the scientific and technical skills among the learners simultaneously.",
          "Department of Applied Chemistry",
          "The Department of Applied Chemistry is one of the pioneer department in the Institute since its commencement in 1956. This department has been helping to meet the demands of PG level scientific students and UG level engineering students in a variety of disciplines. In the beginning, the department was only involved in the teaching of UG engineering, later on the department started the two year PG Programme M.Sc. in Applied Chemistry affiliated to Barkatullah University, Bhopal since 1972. The Department has highly qualified faculty members who are actively engaged in R&D work in different areas of science and technology. More than 15 Ph.D. degrees have been awarded under this department. Department has well equipped Instrumental and Conventional laboratories.",
          "For first-year B.Tech. Students, the Applied Chemistry subject is offered by the Department of Applied Science. The courses cover a wide range of chemistry topics, including physical chemistry, inorganic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and instrumental techniques. The B.Tech. students get hands-on training using a variety of analytical tools, including pH metre, conductometer, potentiometer, colorimeter, UV-Visible Double Beam Spectrophotometer, Flash and fire point apparatus, Redwood viscometers, etc., which are often used in industries and research laboratories all over the world. The goal of the Applied Chemistry course is to cultivate student’s scientific abilities.",
          "According to the requirements of today's industries, notably those in the pharmaceutical, cement, paint, fertiliser, and petrochemical sectors, the subject of applied chemistry seeks to provide a strong chemistry foundation. We fervently think that students who get careful instruction will be employable by industries and able to meet future societal requirements.",

          "Department Vision\n  \nWe aim to enhance scientific research standards in the fields of knowledge, the sill level and we try to keep the students abreast with the information of recent scientific developments.\n\n\n\n\nDepartment Mission\n\n\nThe department of Applied Science works with a mission of generating between core areas of basic science and engineering, so that the outcome is a generation of better mental abilities for understanding, communicating and solving the engineering problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Applied Science was set up in 1957 to impart higher education in Engineering Physics, Applied Chemistry and Applied Mathematics in addition to take up courses to three core engineering branches i.e. Civil, Electrical and Mechanical in 1st and 2nd year. In the Department Post graduate and Ph.D. courses was started in 1965. Presently the department teaches papers in Engineering Physics, Applied Chemistry and Mathematics to all the branches of Engineering. The Department of Applied Science has acquired and accomplished a number of Projects in the field of science and technology, funded from reputed organizations like AICTE, New Delhi and MPCST, Bhopal attributable to key areas of research such as Nanomaterials, Electronics, Atmospheric Physics, Organic and Inorganic Chemistry. \nRe-designated as the Department of Applied Science from the academic session 2020-2021, the department brings together the well qualified and experienced faculties from the Physics, Chemistry and Humanities stream as the department aims to provide learner centric education to the students of First Year through innovative and methodical approach. The department looks towards inculcating the technical and the behavioral skills among the learners simultaneously.",
